    <h3>Damian Northup – Turning Dreams into Independence</h3>
      <p>Damian Northup’s journey is a powerful testament to resilience, creativity, and the strength of self-determination. As a young man growing up in foster care, Damian spent most of his youth living in a group home. During that time, he faced many of the challenges that come with transition—uncertainty, change, and the search for stability.Damian also possessed something extraordinary: a quiet confidence in who he is, and a vivid imagination expressed through his art.</p>

          <p>With the support of dedicated adults and his own inner drive, Damian successfully transitioned out of high school and into an apartment of his own. It was a big step, but one he took with courage. Today, he lives independently with only limited support, proving daily that he is capable of creating and maintaining a life on his own terms.</p>
          
          <p>Damian also holds a competitive job, working four hours a day in a position that values his consistency, effort, and unique contributions. His employer appreciates his reliability and his commitment to doing his best, and Damian takes pride in his work.</p>
          
          <p>Beyond his independence and employment success, Damian is an artist at heart. He expresses his hopes, dreams, and personal story through his artwork. Whether through drawing, or design, Damian has a way of showing the world how he sees it—full of color, possibility, and meaning. His creativity is not just a hobby; it’s a powerful form of communication and self-advocacy.</p>
          
          <p>Damian Northup is living proof that with the right supports, the belief of others, and an unwavering sense of self, young people can overcome barriers and thrive. His story inspires others—young people and professionals alike—reminding us all that success looks different for everyone, and that every step forward is worth celebrating.</p>

    <h2>Parent Statements</h2>
      <p>Thank you to the Skil team for all they have provided to Devonta while he has been on the waiting list.
         It has been so wonderful knowing Devonta had support during this transition.  Devonta has been given so much. He received day service which provided employment training, independent skills training, peer support, and then the youth group that meets to provide team growth that Devonta has excelled at. All this has made Devonta feel so needed and accepted! Can't say enough about how SKIL have been there for us!<br> Thanks to all the SKIL team .
